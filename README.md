# Emotion-Detection-
Excited to share my latest project on Emotion Detection using Deep Learning! Leveraging Python libraries like TensorFlow and OpenCV, I've trained a model to recognize emotions like Angry, Happy, Sad, and more. Check out the Jupyter Notebook for the model training and the GUI application for real-time emotion detection.
